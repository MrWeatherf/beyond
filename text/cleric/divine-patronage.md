# Divine Patronage
The god have gifted you with magic. Gain the Commune and Cast a Spell moves.

## Commune

When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet communion with your
deity, you:

* Lose any spells already granted to you.
* Are granted new spells of your choice whose total levels don’t exceed your
  own level+1, and none of which is a higher level than your own level.
* Prepare all of your rotes, which never count against your limit.

## Cast a Spell

When you unleash a spell granted to you by your deity, roll+2. On a 10+, the
spell is successfully cast and your deity does not revoke the spell, so you may
cast it again. On a 7–9, the spell is cast, but choose one:

* You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you
  how.
* Your casting distances you from your deity—take -1 ongoing to cast a spell
  until the next time you commune.
* After you cast it, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot cast the
  spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.

### Abilities
* [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Marked: +1
* [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Empower Magic: On a 10+ you have the option of choosing from
  the 7-9 list. If you do, you may maximize the spells effects or double its
  targets.
* [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Chosen: The spell _____ counts as a rote for you.
* [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Devoted Healer: When you heal someone else of damage, add
  your level to the amount of damage healed.

## Spells

### Rotes

#### Light

An item you touch glows with divine light, about as bright as a torch. It gives
off no heat or sound and requires no fuel but is otherwise like a mundane
torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame. The spell lasts as
long as it is in your presence.

#### Sanctify

Food or water you hold in your hands while you cast this spell is consecrated
by your deity. In addition to now being holy or unholy, the affected substance
is purified of any mundane spoilage.

#### Guidance

The symbol of your deity appears before you and gestures towards the direction
or course of action your deity would have you take then disappears. The message
is through gesture only; your communication through this spell is severely
limited.

### 1st Level

#### Bless

Your deity smiles upon a combatant of your choice. They take +1 ongoing so long
as battle continues and they stand and fight. While this spell is ongoing you
take -1 to cast a spell.

#### Cure Light Wounds

At your touch wounds scab and bones cease to ache. Heal an ally you touch of
1d6 damage.

#### Cause Fear

Choose a target you can see and a nearby object. The target is afraid of the
object so long as you maintain the spell. Their reaction is up to them: flee,
panic, beg, fight. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell. You
cannot target entities with less than animal intelligence (magical constructs,
undead, automatons, and the like).

#### Magic Weapon

The weapon you hold while casting does +1d4 damage until you dismiss this
spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

#### Sanctuary

As you cast this spell, you walk the perimeter of an area, consecrating it to
your deity. As long as you stay within that area you are alerted whenever
someone acts with malice within the sanctuary (including entering with harmful
intent). Anyone who receives healing within a sanctuary heals +1d4 HP.

#### Speak With Dead

A corpse converses with you briefly. It will answer any three questions you
pose to it to the best of the knowledge it had in life and the knowledge it
gained in death.
