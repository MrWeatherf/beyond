# Mystic Patron

You have the patronage of a mystical entity. You gain the Patron, Dark Bargain,
and Desperate Plea moves.

## Patron

You have a connection to an entity connected to one of the fundamental forces
of magic. Note their name (as best you know it, maybe Palmon, The Queen of
Tears, or Fists-of-Stars) and choose one for each:

* Name: _____________
* Sign
  * A dimming of lights
  * Insects and rodents
  * An inaudible rumble
  * A scent of spice
* Seeming
  * Glum and gloomy
  * Cold
  * Aristocratic
  * Cruel and uncaring
  * Joyous
* Interest
  * Mortal memories
  * Souls
  * Reshaping the world
  * Sacrifices
* Powers
  * Shadows
  * Creatures of the dark
  * Flames
  * Frost

## Dark Bargain

When you tell your patron what you want and make it known you will pay the GM
will name a cost for each that is true:

* The request is not in your patron's interest
* The request is hard to accomplish with their powers
* Your patron is happy with you

Potential costs include:

* Retrieving something of value
* Destroying an obstacle
* Spreading the sign of your patron
* Causing embarassament to their enemies

## Desparate Plea

When you look to your arcane patron in a moment of need, roll+0. On a 10+ their
agenda aligns with yours for the moment: some manifestation of their power will
remove you from danger, at least for the moment. On a 7-9 you are still too
useful to lose, but there is a cost: they will preserve you, but hold 1 over
you. Expect them to claim something that is yours at the worst time. So long as
they have hold over you, they will not answer another desparate plea.
