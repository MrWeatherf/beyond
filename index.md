# Beyond

*A Fantasy Adventure Game By Sage LaTorra*

## Introduction

The world is broken but that's not the problem. A magical mishap
collided the world with its own past, future, and a few parallel
realities. A wizard's tower sits atop a nuclear reactor drawing on that
power the same way it had drawn on the ley lines. Giant eagles take to
pirating from their new floating roost aboard an aircraft carrier.
Dinosaurs fight for food with owlbears.

Those aren't really problems, though. People returned to life easily
enough, adapting as people always do. Turns out being a car mechanic
isn't all that different from repairing magical automatons. The problem
is that people have taken advantage of the upheaval to revel in their
greed, power, and gluttony. It's the same problem we've always had, but
now powered by a world in flux.

You set out into this world to do what is right, to protect those who
cannot protect themselves, to test your mettle and better yourself
facing those who would live off the work of others.

## A Fantasy Adventure Game

*Beyond* is a fantasy adventure game drawing on a long lineage of
similar games. It aims to embrace the parts of the genre that work while
also moving it forward. You'll need a GM and 3-5 players.

You can view this playtest version as [a web
page](http://www.latorra.org/beyond/), [PDF](/release/Beyond.pdf), or
the [raw source](https://github.com/Sagelt/beyond/). You can send
feedback to me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/olde_fortran) or by
[filing an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/Sagelt/beyond/issues/new/choose).

Oh, and the name *Beyond* is probably a placeholder. Or maybe not. Who
knows.

## Quick Start Guide From Dungeon World

*Beyond* is based on *Dungeon World*, but it isn't a new edition of that
game. It considerably shifts the mechanics, procedures, and setting.
Since this is a playtest and is incomplete this section helps fill in
the game: you can just assume this is *Dungeon* World except that...

-   There are no stats. Each move has its own bonus which advances on
    its own.
-   Rolling a 6- doesn't grant XP. Instead it grants advancement towards
    abilities on that specific move.
-   There are no debilities. Instead there are conditions on each move.
    Each works differently.
-   There is no end of session XP. Instead each playbook has its own XP
    criteria which you mark as you do those things.
-   There are no moves for being an elf, dwarf, or whatever sentient
    creature. Being an elf, dwarf, or human is just your form, noted on
    your character sheet.
-   The core moves are called Adventurer moves and each playbook has
    their own copy of them. The base moves are the same, but each
    playbook has different abilities and conditions for them.
-   Bonds now change categories of success (from 6- to 7-9 and from 7-9
    to 10+). Each time you use the bond you mark advancement on it until
    you retire the bond and gain its ability.
-   Each character has reserve dice. Reserve dice can be added to any
    roll. If a reserve die is added to a roll you add the number rolled
    on the reserve die to the total. When you have time to rest and
    recover you roll all your remaining reserve dice and gain HP equal
    to the total (up to your max), then refill your reserve dice to your
    starting amount.
-   Alignment is replaced by allegiance. Allegiance can be to a big
    concept, like Good, or to a specific group, entity, or ideal.
-   All the player characters share a goal. The first goal is provided
    by the GM to kick off the game. Once that goal is completed the
    party writes a new one, but they have to agree on it. The goal is
    what unites this group of people beyond their direct bonds to one
    another.
-   Monsters are represented by a single die indicating their strength
    in the current situation. Their damage is equal to that die, their
    HP is equal to the number of sides on that die, and their armor is
    equal to the number of sides divided by 4 (round down).

## Playing Beyond

Each player chooses a playbook. The currently available playbooks are:

-   [The Wizard](#the-wizard)

The GM provides a starting Goal for the party, then opens the adventure
at a key moment in pursuing that goal.

# The Wizard

You have all the Adventurer Moves.

Choose three class moves to start with from among your themes. Your
themes are [Towermage](#towermage-theme), [Ritualist](#ritualist-theme),
and [Warlock](#warlock-theme). You must take the first move in each
theme before taking any below it. Indicate your move by marking it (put
an x: (x) to show you have the move).

When you roll a 6-, mark one of the advancement boxes \[ \] below the
move you rolled by adding an x (like this: \[x\]). When all the
advancement boxes for an ability are filled in you gain that ability.
You may fill advancement boxes in any order you like.

When you take a condition (when a move says to or when the GM says to)
fill in any condition box \< \> for any move. That condition applies
until a move or the GM tells you to remove a condition.

## Look

-   Wild eyes, wise eyes, burning eyes
-   Scrawny body, scarred body, twisted body, enchanted body
-   Bald, flowing hair, unnatural hair, styled hair
-   Dwarf, Elf, Human, Halfling, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Adventurer Moves

### Defy Danger

When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how
you deal with it and roll. On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the
threat doesn't come to bear. On a 7--9, you stumble, hesitate, or
flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly
choice.

#### Abilities

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Sharp: Take +1 when you act through an
    improvisation and quick thinking.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Hard Headed: Take +1 when you act through
    mental fortitude.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Magical Inversion: When the
    danger you face is magical and you roll a 12+ you can subsume the
    magical power and gain power from it.

#### Conditions

-   \< \> Cowardly: When you roll a 9- you must also immediately act to
    remove yourself from the situation, dropping whatever else you were
    doing.
-   \< \> Shaken: -1

### Spout Lore

When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll+1. On
a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the
subject relevant to your situation. On a 7--9, the GM will only tell you
something interesting---it's on you to make it useful. The GM might ask
you "How do you know this?" Tell them the truth, now.

When you closely study a situation or person, roll+1. On a 10+, ask the
GM 3 questions from the list below. On a 7--9, ask 1. Either way, take
+1 forward when acting on the answers.

-   What happened here recently?
-   What is about to happen?
-   What should I be on the lookout for?
-   What here is useful or valuable to me?

    "what happened here in the distant past which is relevant now?"

#### Conditions

-   \< \> Disoriented: -1

### Parley

When you have leverage on a GM Character and push them to do what you
want, roll. On a 10+, they do what you ask if you first promise what
they ask of you. On a 7--9, they will do what you ask, but need some
concrete assurance of your promise, right now.

#### Abilities

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Renown: Take +1 among those that have
    heard tales of when you \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Parlor Tricks: Take +1 when parleying
    someone who has recently seen a display of your power.

#### Conditions

-   \< \> Witchmark: You have some magical alteration of your being that
    is disconcerting or distracting, take -1.

### Hack and Slash

When you engage an enemy in melee, roll-1. On a 10+, you deal your
damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may

7--9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack
against you.

#### Conditions

-   \< \> Wounded: No matter the result you take 1 damage (in addition
    to any other results).

### Volley

When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, roll. On a 10+, you
have a clear shot---deal your damage. On a 7--9, choose one (whichever
you choose you deal your damage):

-   You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described
    by the GM
-   You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage
-   You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one

#### Abilities

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Trueshot: Take +2 when targeting someone
    recently affected by one of your spells
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Innate Magic Missile: You can

-   First you must \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
-   You'll need help from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

it does, the GM will answer you truthfully.

#### ( ) Self-Powered

When you have time, arcane materials, and a safe space, you can create

temporarily suspended and you gain a reserve die up to your maximum.

##### Abilities

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Amplifier: The reserve dice you gain
    through Omega are d8 instead of d6.

## Bonds

Choose a bond. When your bond applies to a roll you make you or the
target of the bond may increase the result of a roll by one category (6-
to 7-9, 7-9 to 10+) and mark a bond advancement. When all advancements
are marked choose a new bond in place of the one that you completed (but
keep the ability).

-   ( ) There is a power in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that I want to understand.
    -   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Expanded Horizons: You may also take
        moves from \_\_\_\_\_\_'s class
-   ( ) I believe an ancient prophecy is about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I must
    protect them.

set a new goal in collaboration with the other players.

-   A magical trinket: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   A scrap of lore: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   Two healing potions (drink to recover a reserve dice)
-   Supplies (5)

# Spellbook

When you gain a spellbook you get the Prepare Spells and Cast A Spell
moves. Your spellbook starts with 3 1st level spells and all the
cantrips.

## Prepare Spells

When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet contemplation
of your spellbook, you:

-   Lose any spells you already have prepared.
-   Prepare new spells of your choice from your spellbook whose total
    levels don't exceed your own level+1.
-   Prepare your cantrips which never count against your limit.

## Cast A Spell

When you release a spell you've prepared, roll+2. On a 10+, the spell is
successfully cast and you do not forget the spell---you may cast it
again later. On a 7-9, the spell is cast, but choose one:

-   You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will
    tell you how.
-   The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast---take -1
    ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.
-   After it is cast, the spell is forgotten. You cannot cast the spell
    again until you prepare spells.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a
penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

### Abilities

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Trial And Error: Gain a new spell of your
    level or lower, then erase all advancement from this ability.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Master Caster: +1
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Empower Magic: On a 10+ you have the
    option of choosing from the 7-9 list. If you do, you may maximize
    the spells effects or double its targets.

### Conditions

-   \< \> Leaky Mind: On a hit you always forget the spell, in addition
    to any other choice you have to make.

## Cantrips

### Light

An item you touch glows with arcane light, about as bright as a torch.
It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel, but it is otherwise
like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the
flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.

### Unseen Servant

You conjure a simple invisible construct that can do nothing but carry
items. It can carry anything you could carry with one arm. It cannot
pick up items on its own and can only carry those you give to it. Items
carried by an unseen servant appear to float in the air a few paces
behind you. An unseen servant that takes damage or leaves your presence
is immediately dispelled, dropping any items it carried. Otherwise the
unseen servant serves you until you end the spell.

### Prestidigitation

You perform minor tricks of true magic. If you touch an item as part of
the casting you can make cosmetic changes to it: clean it, soil it, cool
it, warm it, flavor it, or change its color. If you cast the spell
without touching an item you can instead create minor illusions no
bigger than yourself. Prestidigitation illusions are crude and clearly
illusions---they won't fool anyone, but they might entertain them.

## 1st Level

### Contact Spirits

Name the spirit you wish to contact (or leave it to the GM). You pull
that creature through the planes, just close enough to speak to you. It
is bound to answer any one question you ask to the best of its ability.

### Detect Magic

One of your senses is briefly attuned to magic. The GM will tell you
what here is magical.

### Telepathy

You form a telepathic bond with a single person you touch, enabling you
to converse with that person through your thoughts. You can only have
one telepathic bond at a time.

### Invisibility

Touch an ally: nobody can see them. They're invisible! The spell
persists until the target attacks or you dismiss the effect. While the
spell is ongoing you can't cast a spell.

### Magic Missile

Projectiles of pure magic spring from your fingers. Deal 2d4 damage to
one target.

### Alarm

Walk a wide circle as you cast this spell. Until you prepare spells
again your magic will alert you if a creature crosses that circle. Even
if you are asleep, the spell will shake you from your slumber. \# Mystic
Patron

You have the patronage of a mystical entity. You gain the Patron, Dark
Bargain, and Desperate Plea moves.

## Patron

You have a connection to an entity connected to one of the fundamental
forces of magic. Note their name (as best you know it, maybe Palmon, The
Queen of Tears, or Fists-of-Stars) and choose one for each:

-   Name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   Sign
    -   A dimming of lights
    -   Insects and rodents
    -   An inaudible rumble
    -   A scent of spice
-   Seeming
    -   Glum and gloomy
    -   Cold
    -   Aristocratic
    -   Cruel and uncaring
    -   Joyous
-   Interest
    -   Mortal memories
    -   Souls
    -   Reshaping the world
    -   Sacrifices
-   Powers
    -   Shadows
    -   Creatures of the dark
    -   Flames
    -   Frost

## Dark Bargain

When you tell your patron what you want and make it known you will pay
the GM will name a cost for each that is true:

-   The request is not in your patron's interest
-   The request is hard to accomplish with their powers
-   Your patron is happy with you

Potential costs include:

-   Retrieving something of value
-   Destroying an obstacle
-   Spreading the sign of your patron
-   Causing embarassament to their enemies

## Desparate Plea

When you look to your arcane patron in a moment of need, roll. On a 10+
their agenda aligns with yours for the moment: some manifestation of
their power will remove you from danger, at least for the moment. On a
7-9 you are still too useful to lose, but there is a cost: they will
preserve you, but hold 1 over you. Expect them to claim something that
is yours at the worst time. So long as they have hold over you, they
will not answer another desparate plea.
